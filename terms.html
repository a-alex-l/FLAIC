    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: 2025.07.29</em></p>

    <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
    <p>
      By accessing or using our service, FLAIC (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Service. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who wish to access or use the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your use of the Service is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated here by reference.
    </p>

    <h2>2. The Service</h2>
    <p>
      FLAIC provides a web-based tool that allows users to generate visual comics and stories ("Content") using third-party generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) services (e.g., Google's Gemini). To use the Service, you must provide your own API key for the respective third-party AI service. We provide the interface and the tool; the AI processing is performed by the third-party service you choose to use.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Your API Keys</h2>
    <p>
      You are solely responsible for obtaining and securing your own API keys. We operate on a "zero-knowledge" principle regarding your keys.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>For API calls made directly from your browser to the third-party service, we **never** see, handle, or store your API key on our servers.</li>
      <li>For your convenience, and with your explicit consent, we may offer to store your API key in your browser's local storage. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to us.</li>
      <li>In cases where a proxy is required to facilitate a connection to a third-party service due to technical limitations (e.g., CORS), your API key will pass through our server in-memory for the sole purpose of relaying the request. It is **never logged or stored persistently** on our systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. User-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>
      You retain all ownership rights to the prompts you submit and the comics you generate ("User Content").
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if you choose to use the "Share" feature of the Service, you grant FLAIC a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, display, reproduce, and distribute your User Content for the sole purpose of making that content accessible via the unique link you have shared. If you do not use the "Share" feature, this license is not granted.
    </p>

    <h2>5. User Conduct</h2>
    <p>You agree not to use the Service to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create or transmit any content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
      <li>Violate the intellectual property rights or privacy rights of any third party.</li>
      <li>Violate the terms of service of the third-party AI provider (e.g., Google).</li>
      <li>Attempt to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to the Service or its related systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Advertisements</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is currently free to use and is supported by advertising. You agree that we may display advertisements within the application, which may include placements between pages of generated content or elsewhere in the user interface.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We make no warranties, express or implied, that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the output, accuracy, or quality of the content generated by the third-party AI services. The content generated does not represent the views of FLAIC.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, FLAIC shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (b) any content obtained from the Service, including content generated by third-party AI.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms. You may cease using the Service at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of any changes by posting the new Terms on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your Country/State, e.g., "the State of California, United States"], without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
