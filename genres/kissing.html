  <h2>Why FLAIC is the Ultimate Romance Game Creator</h2>
  <p>FLAIC is more than just a story writer; it's a dynamic engine for creating the exact romance simulation games you want to play.</p>

  <h3>A True Romance Simulator</h3>
  <p>Your choices create real consequences. The AI tracks relationship dynamics, building tension and affection based on your actions. A shy glance, a bold confession, or a stolen kiss all change the story's direction, making the journey to that perfect first love kiss feel earned and unique.</p>

  <h3>Create Any Scenario You Desire</h3>
  <p>Dreaming of a specific fantasy? FLAIC can build it. Create a high-stakes office kissing game where you navigate professional boundaries and secret desires. Or, design a dramatic, high-emotion story inspired by the love sick game, full of rivals, twists, and passionate encounters. The setting and plot are yours to command.</p>

  <h3>Go Beyond Pre-Set Choices</h3>
  <p>Standard kissing games online give you limited options. FLAIC gives you unlimited control. You're not choosing from a list; you're writing the action. Describe the exact way they lean in, the words they whisper, or the interruption that heightens the tension. The AI will bring your specific vision to life.</p>

  <h2>Start Your Romance Sim in 30 Seconds</h2>
  <ol class="step-by-step">
      <li>Describe Your Scene: Start with a simple prompt. It can be a full concept like, "A forbidden office kiss between two rivals during a late-night project," or just keywords like "love sick, high school, first kiss."</li>
      <li>Generate the Moment: With a single click, FLAIC sets the scene, introduces the characters, and provides a romantic illustration to capture the mood.</li>
      <li>Control the Chemistry: You're in charge of the pacing. Change "She looked away" to "She closed the distance between them," and watch the AI adapt the story to your lead, making a truly interactive kissing game.</li>
      <li>Play Your Own Story: Continue generating new scenes, navigating the relationship's challenges, and guiding your characters to their romantic fate.</li>
  </ol>
