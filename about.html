  <h2>About FLAIC (Fantasy Life AI Choices)</h2>
  <p>FLAIC is an open-source, indie game development project born from a passion for storytelling and technological innovation. We provide a gateway to infinite, AI-powered interactive narratives, placing the power of creation directly in your hands.</p>

  <h2>Our Mission: Democratizing Creative Storytelling</h2>
  <p>Have you ever wished you could step into a story and shape its destiny? FLAIC transforms that wish into a reality. Our mission is to build a revolutionary space where your imagination collaborates with powerful AI to create unique, illustrated stories. We believe everyone has a story to tell, and we provide the tools to bring any world you can imagine to life.</p>

  <h3>How It's Free: Your AI, Your Story</h3>
  <p>FLAIC is fundamentally an innovative interface, not a service that hosts AI models. This is crucial to how we operate and why our platform is free of charge. Instead of us charging you for AI usage, you connect the AI models you have already purchased or have access to. [4, 5, 13] Simply bring your own API key for a variety of supported Large Language Models (LLMs) and image generators and plug it directly into our system. [4, 5, 10] This approach provides two major benefits:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No Extra Cost:</strong> You are using the AI subscriptions you already own, so there are no new fees from us. You maintain your own billing relationship with your AI provider. [4, 5]</li>
    <li><strong>Complete Control:</strong> You have the flexibility to choose the specific AI models and providers you prefer, giving you ultimate control over the style, tone, and quality of your narrative and illustrations. [4]</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Creative Process: From Spark to Saga</h2>
  <p>The journey from a simple idea to a complete visual saga is an empowering and intuitive experience on our platform.</p>
  
  <h3>1. The Spark of an Idea</h3>
  <p>Every great story begins with a single seed. You can provide a specific prompt for a story—a detailed character, a unique world, a complex plot—or let our system ignite your creativity with a randomly generated idea. This initial spark is all the AI needs to begin construction.</p>

  <h3>2. World-Building and Narrative Weaving</h3>
  <p>From that single prompt, our platform interfaces with your chosen Large Language Model (LLM). The AI gets to work, constructing a detailed world, developing compelling characters with distinct personalities, and weaving an engaging plot filled with potential twists and turns.</p>

  <h3>3. A Visual Saga Unfolds</h3>
  <p>A story is more than just words. We bring your narrative to life through a unique episodic format. Each segment of the story is paired with a stunning, AI-generated illustration based on your selected art style. This creates a rich visual experience, akin to a personalized comic book or a dynamic visual novel.</p>

  <h2>The Magic of Interactivity: You Are the Author</h2>
  <p>The true magic of FLAIC lies in its deep interactivity. You are never a passive observer; you are the co-author, guiding the narrative at every step.</p>
  
  <h3>The Power to Shape Destiny</h3>
  <p>At every crucial story point, you have the power to influence the outcome through meaningful choices. If the AI generates "The knight drew his sword," you can alter it to "The knight hesitated, his hand trembling." The AI will instantly adapt, branching the narrative down a new, unexpected path. Every choice you make genuinely shapes your journey and its conclusion.</p>

  <h3>A Universe of Possibilities Awaits</h3>
  <p>What kind of story will you create? The possibilities are truly endless. You can become a legendary hero, experience reincarnation in another world, or unravel a dark fantasy mystery. The choice is entirely yours. Will you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Attend a prestigious <strong>magic school</strong> and master arcane arts?</li>
    <li>Unravel the secrets of a <strong>dark fantasy</strong> in a gripping <strong>mystery adventure</strong>?</li>
    <li>Craft an intricate <strong>elf love story</strong> or pursue a passionate <strong>fate romance</strong>?</li>
    <li>Or even build your own <strong>harem</strong> in a unique <strong>isekai demon waifu</strong> simulation?</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Your Story, Your Style, Your Tools</h2>
  <p>We believe in empowering our creators with full control. You dictate the aesthetic with the ability to choose from various art style prompts to perfectly match your story's tone. When your masterpiece is complete, you can save and export the entire illustrated journey as a PDF, creating a permanent, shareable version of your unique creation.</p>
  
  <h2>An Open, Community-Driven Project</h2>
